Typography:

The font sans serif was selected because of its simplicity design allowing just
anyone to read withouth a strugle when comared to a cursive style. Spacing for translated 
words and results were made a little more bigger to help other have a easier time diferenciating line,
from others, this is also the reason for adding table border. In relation to layout, we decided to
center entire container since id be unconformable to just be looking to one edge of the screen
haveing the device directly inform of oneself. Size was made to expand automatically. this was done
because we also decided not to limit number of rows since should a person want to go back and see a 
previously translated word, he/she ccan simple scroll down to find and not spend time translating to once again
come across the randomly goven word. as for text size, it was left pretty large for eassy reading.
as for font weight, it was left as strong to give an easier time reading.


color pallette:
for wrong and correct asnwers, we decided to completly contrast colors since the difference can 
be seen immediatly. as for background color for container we decided to use a dark gray since 
it goes eassy on the eye and doesnt conflict with text color choosen.
